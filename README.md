# pitfall-pilot
A game with a team of 3 other people in Software Design and Development. This was a semester long project that not only taught me about Unity and game design. I also learned about how to properly document and schedule a software project and some of the development strategies that are widely used in the industry.

Play as a ship going through randomly generated sections of tunnels. Avoid obstacles and try to get the highest score.
